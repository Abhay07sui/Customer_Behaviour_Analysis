# Customer_Behaviour_Analysis
Data Analytics Project showcasing Customer_Behaviour_Analysis using Python, SQL, Power BI.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

✅ Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

✅ Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.


🧠 Customer Behaviour Analysis
📘 Overview

This project explores customer purchasing behavior through data analytics. It includes data loading and cleaning in Python, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), running SQL queries for insights, building a Power BI dashboard for visualization, and presenting results through a professional Gamma presentation. The goal is to understand how customer demographics, discounts, subscriptions, and shipping preferences influence purchase behavior and revenue.

📊 Dataset

Name: Customer Behaviour Dataset

Contents:

Customer demographics (age, gender, subscription status)

Purchase details (item purchased, category, purchase amount, review rating)

Transactional data (discounts, shipping type, previous purchases)

Source: Provided as part of this project (Customer_Behaviour_Analysis.ipynb)

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA & cleaning)

SQL: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server (for analytical queries)

Power BI: Interactive dashboards and visual insights

Gamma App: Presentation and storytelling

Jupyter Notebook: Code execution and analysis documentation

⚙️ Steps / Workflow

Data Loading: Import dataset into Python and examine structure.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data types.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

Identify spending patterns across gender, age, and subscription status.

Analyze purchase frequency, discount effects, and product performance.

SQL Analysis:
Run advanced queries (from customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql) to extract insights such as:

Gender-wise revenue contribution

Effect of discounts on purchases

Top-rated and most purchased products

Revenue segmentation by age group and subscription

Dashboard Building (Power BI):

Connect cleaned data to Power BI.

Create visuals for KPIs: revenue by gender, category, age group, and subscription status.

Build interactive filters for deeper analysis.

Reporting:

Export dashboard visuals.

Generate insights summary.

Presentation:

Created a summary deck in Gamma highlighting methods, findings, and recommendations.

Total Revenue Overview

Customer Segmentation by Loyalty

Discount vs. Purchase Impact

Age Group Revenue Analysis

Subscription and Spending Comparison

📊 Results & Insights

Female customers contributed slightly higher overall revenue.

Subscribers spent more on average compared to non-subscribers.

Discount usage didn’t always correlate with higher spending.

Express shipping customers had a higher average purchase value.

Top categories and loyal customers were key revenue drivers.
